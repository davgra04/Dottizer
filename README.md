Dottizer
========

This tool is intended to make construction of LED dot wall art, [inspired by ewoolsey's Reddit post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2cp73r/hey_diy_remember_that_abstract_world_map_art), easier by determining drill bit sizes needed for each dot.

## Requirements

Python Image Library
Tkinter
